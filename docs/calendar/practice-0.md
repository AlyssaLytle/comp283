# Practice and Review 0

Here are the practice problems to prepare you for the quiz! I will try and cover as many as possible, but please come to the review session with requests! We can also review problems from the lessons, but I encourage you to use office hours for this as well!

## Problems

### Logic 

1. Prove $$a \leftrightarrow b \equiv (a \rightarrow b) \land (b \rightarrow a)$$ using a truth table.

2. True or False: You can prove compound propositions $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are logically equivalent by showing $$X \leftrightarrow Y$$ is a tautology. Explain your answer.
(Hint, try this for the equivalence $$p \rightarrow q \equiv \neg p \lor q$$)

3. True or False: $$((a \lor b) \oplus \neg b) \lor \texttt{True}$$ always evaluates to $$\texttt{True}$$ regardless of the values of $$a$$ and $$b$$. Explain your answer.


### Relations

4. For this problem, let:

* $$S$$ be the set of all coins I possess. It could potentially contain any coin type from any country of the world.
* $$C$$ be the set of coin purses (Coins go IN these)
* Let $$p(x)$$ be a predicate:  $$\forall x \in S$$, $$p(x)$$ is True $$\leftrightarrow x$$ is a penny. 
* Let $$e(x)$$ be a predicate:  $$\forall x \in S$$, $$e(x)$$ is True $$\leftrightarrow x$$ is a euro. 
* Let $$IN(x,c)$$ be a predicate:  $$\forall x \in S, \forall c \in C$$, $$In(x,c)$$ is True $$\leftrightarrow$$ coin $$x$$ is in coin purse $$c$$. 
* Let $$q(c)$$ be a function that returns the number of coins in coin purse $$c$$.

Express the following using predicate logic:

> 4.1. No penny is a euro.

> 4.2. There are coin purses of different sizes.

> 4.3. There is a coin purse for every coin.

> 4.4. No coin is without a coin purse. (Extra question: can there be an empty coin purse?)

> 4.5. A coin purse with a euro must contain two coins.

> 4.6. No coin purse holds both pennies and euros.
