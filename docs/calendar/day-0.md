# Day 0

## Welcome to 283!

Today will be an easier day, focused on getting you set up for the course! Make sure you complete the two assignments on Gradescope! 

We've also added an Intro to Coding lesson to this page. If you've already taken Comp 110 or its equivalent, you can skip this lesson. If you have no prior coding experience, this will help prepare you for some of the code you will see in this course.
