# Algorithms

An *algorithm* is just a series of steps that return a result. They are usually used to help you get a more optimal result. (E.g. perform the task more accurately, faster, cheaper, etc.)

## Day-to-day examples

Some common examples of algorithms you might use in your day-to-day are:

- Following a meal prep guide to help you eat healthier and save money.
- Following a routine in the gym to maximize your fitness goals.
- Choosing your class schedule to fit your preferences. 

## Anatomy of an Algorithm

An algorithm is given at least one *input*,

it performs a *series of steps*,

and it returns a *result*.

Note that an algorithm may be influenced by its environment and it may  produce side-effects which influence its environment. (I'll give an example of this soon!)
