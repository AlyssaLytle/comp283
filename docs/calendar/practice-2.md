# Review and Practice 2

## Questions



1. Direct Proof (from [ADS](https://discretemath.org/))

Prove that the sum of two odd positive integers is an even positive integer.

2. Proof

Prove the following statement:

> If $$n^2$$ is odd, then $$n$$ is odd.

(Hint: Try a proof by contrapositive or proof by contradiction.)

3. Proof (from [ADS](https://discretemath.org/)) 
Prove that if $$x$$ and $$y$$ are real numbers such that $$x +y \leq 1$$, then $$x \leq 1/2$$ or $$y \leq 1/2$$.

(Hint: Try a proof by contrapositive or proof by contradiction.)

4. For finite sets $$X$$ and $$Y$$, how you would *exhaustively* prove that $$f: X \to Y$$ is a bijection?
