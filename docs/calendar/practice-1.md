# Review and Practice 1

Here are the practice problems to prepare you for the quiz! I will try and cover as many as possible, but please come to the review session with requests! We can also review problems from the lessons, but I encourage you to use office hours for this as well!

# Problems

## 1. Functions

For this problem, we will be discussing this figure:
<img src="/comp283/static/figs/fn-fig.png" style="width:100%">

1.1 Is $$f$$ a total function?

1.2. Is $$g$$ a total function?

1.3. Is $$g$$ a bijection?

1.4. Let $$h=g\circ f$$. Is $$h$$ is a total function?

1.5. Is $$h$$ a bijection?



# Solutions

1. First, we start with the definition of a total function.

A\times B$$ is a  function  iff  
$$\forall a\in A\  \exists b_1\in B\  \bigl((a,b_1)\in f
\bigr)\land \bigl(\forall b_2\in B\  ({(a,b_2)\in f} \rightarrow {b_2 =
b_1}) \bigr).$$

Let's break this into two properties (like we did in the lesson):

- $$\forall a\in A\  \exists b_1\in B\  \bigl((a,b_1)\in f
\bigr)$$

- $$ \forall b_2\in B\  ({(a,b_2)\in f} \rightarrow {b_2 =
b_1}).$$

Now let's plug in the function and set names.
