## Recursion


There is still one type of proof we need to cover... but first we're going to take a little bit of a detour.

It is helpful to understand **recursion** before we move on to the next kind of proof!





## What is recursion?


**Recursion** is the idea of solving a problem by breaking it into smaller problems.

### Example - Factorials:

- A familiar function we know is $$n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$
- We can rewrite this as $$n! = n\cdot (n-1)!$$.
- This is a **recursive** definition because we are computing $$n!$$ by first computing $$(n-1)!$$.




## Recursion in Coding


Here is an example of what recursion would look like in a programming language like Python.

Say we want to write a program that returns $$n!$$.

    Def factorial:
        input: natural number n
        if n == 1: #base case
            return 1
        else: #recursive rule
            return n * factorial(n-1) 
        




## Why do we use recursion?


- Breaking a problem into smaller pieces can make it easier to solve.
- Breaking a problem into smaller pieces can also make it easier to reason about, making it easier to prove properties about it! 
- Many programming languages heavily rely on recursive definitions (haskell, racket, scheme, etc.)
- Other programming languages support it by letting a function call itself. 





## Defining recursion


We just gave an example of a function that is defined recursively.

You can also recursively define sets, relations, tuples, lists, sequences, etc...

There are two main parts of any recursive definition:

1. The base case: the initial element/value of what you're trying to define
2. The recursive rule: tells you how to generate the next element/value given previous ones.

### Example: Factorials

1. The base case: $$1! = 1$$
2. The recursive rule: $$n! = n \cdot (n-1)!$$






## The Fibonacci numbers


- The Fibonacci numbers are a very famous sequence of numbers that are defined via a recursive function.

1. The base case: $$F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1$$
2. Recursive rule: For $$n > 1$$, $$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$$.




## Other Example - Powersets: 



- We can define powersets recursively:
- $$\mathscr{P}(X + \{c\} ) = \mathscr{P}(X) \cup (\mathscr{P}(X) + \{c\})$$
- E.g. $$\mathscr{P}(\{1,2,3\}) = \mathscr{P}(\{1,2\} + \{3\}) = \mathscr{P}(\{1,2\}) \cup (\mathscr{P}(\{1,2\}) + \{3\})$$
- This is essentially saying we can build a powerset by unioning two smaller sets. We are building something by combining two smaller things. That's what makes this definition **recursive**.


### Definition

1. The base case: $$\mathscr{P}(\{ \}) = \{\}$$
2. The recursive rule: $$\mathscr{P}(X + \{c\}) = \mathscr{P}(X) \cup (\mathscr{P}(X) + \{c\})$$




<!-- ## Defining Functions and Methods Recursively


I want to define a method $$copy$$ such that for all $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$, $$copy(n)=n$$

For this, we are going to use the fact that $$n = 1 \cdot n = 1 + 1 + \ldots + 1$$, $$n$$ times.

1. The base case: $$copy(0) = 0$$
2. Recursive rule: For $$n<0$$, $$copy(n) = 1 + copy(n-1)$$

## Defining Lists Recursively


- We are going to give an example of how we can define a list and some functions on a list recursively
- Say all elements of our list are in set $$A$$
- The set of all possible lists $$L$$ can be defined as $$L = \bigcup_{k\geq0}A^k$$ 
(Aka all possible permutations of length $$k \geq 0$$ of the elements in $$A$$.)
- We can also define this recursively.

1. Base case: Empty list $$\langle ~ \rangle$$
2. Recursive rule: For any element $$a \in A$$ and all lists $$l \in L$$, $$cons(a,l)$$ is a list in $$L$$.

- Basically, $$cons(a,l)$$ takes $$a$$ and attaches it to list $$l$$
- You can think of "$$cons$$" as short for "constructor".




## Defining Lists Recursively


1. Base case: Empty list $$\langle ~ \rangle$$

2. Recursive rule: For any element $$a \in A$$ and all lists $$l \in L$$, $$cons(a,l)$$ is a list in $$L$$.

- Basically, $$cons(a,l)$$ takes $$a$$ and attaches it to list $$l$$


### Examples
- $$\langle b \rangle = cons(b, \langle ~ \rangle)$$
- $$\langle a, b \rangle = cons(a, cons(b, \langle ~ \rangle))$$
- $$\langle a, b, c \rangle = cons(a, cons(b, cons(c, \langle ~ \rangle)))$$




## Useful Partial Functions


- $$head(cons( a,l )) = a$$
- $$tail(cons( a,l )) = l$$
- Note that $$head$$ returns an element and $$tail$$ returns a list!

### Examples

- $$\langle a, b, c \rangle = cons(a, cons(b, cons(c, \langle ~ \rangle)))$$
- $$head(cons(a, cons(b, cons(c, \langle ~ \rangle)))) = a$$
- $$tail(cons(a, cons(b, cons(c, \langle ~ \rangle)))) = cons(b, cons(c, \langle ~ \rangle)) = \langle b, c \rangle$$




## Strings and Languages


- Strings and Languages are likely going to come up later in your computer science education, so it's good to be familiar with these definitions!
- A **string** is a list containing characters from a given **alphabet** $$\Sigma$$
- The set of all possible strings that can be made from an alphabet is $$\Sigma^*$$
- A **language** is a set of strings $$L \subseteq \Sigma^*$$
