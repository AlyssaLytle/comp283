I will be updating this page with more resources, but one thing you can do to prepare for the class is learn more about [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)). This is a mathematical scripting language that helps you type math quickly! It'll be very helpful for a future technical career!
