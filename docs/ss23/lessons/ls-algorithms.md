## Algorithms and Invariants

- An **algorithm** is just a set of instructions to solve a problem.

### Example

   > In class, you wrote an algorithm to find the prime factors of a number.

## What you will learn

- How to come up with an algorithm to solve a given problem
- (Monday) How to express that algorithm in pseudocode
- (Monday) What you can *say* about the algorithm (e.g. what kind of guarantees you can make about the outcome, how long it takes, etc.)
