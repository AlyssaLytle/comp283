## Relations and Functions

### Textbook Chapter 6




## Relations

A **relation** on two sets, $$A$$ and $$B$$ is a subset of pair $$A \times B$$.

### Example 1
> Let's look at the following relation:

> $$R = \{(m,n) \mid m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \land m < n\}$$

> In English: "All pairs of integers $$(m,n)$$ such that $$m<n$$."

> What are our two sets?

> **Answer:**



### Example 2

> Is $$(2,3) \in R$$?




## Example Continued

### Example 3

> Let's look at the following relation:

> $$R = \{(m,n) \mid m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \land m < n\}$$

> In English: "All pairs of integers $$(m,n)$$ such that $$m<n$$."

> Is $$(3,2) \in R$$?

> **Answer:**

## Other Types of Relations

We can use relations to describe many types of relationships!

### Example 4

>Back to our coin purse example...

>Say $$C$$ is a set of coin purses and $$X$$ is a set of coins.

>$$In(x,c) = True \iff$$ coin $$x$$ is in coin purse $$c$$.

>Say we want to see all coins that have a coin purse. We could look at the relation:

> $$R = \{(x,c) \mid x \in X \land c \in C \land In(x,c) \}$$

>This would give us the pairs $$(x,c)$$ of each coin $$x$$ and its corresponding coin purse $$c$$.

## Some Considerations

### Binary Relations

Most of the relations we will talk about will be **binary relations**. 

This is simply a relation with tuples of size $$2$$ (e.g. $$R \subseteq A \times B$$). However, relations can be over many sets (e.g. $$R \subseteq A \times B \times C$$).

### Notation

Another way we could write about elements of relation $$R \subseteq A \times B$$ is:

$$\forall (x,y) \in R, x R y$$

## Other ways we can write relations - Graphs

You may see relations represented in other ways, too. 

You can represent relation $$R \subseteq A \times B$$ using a **graph** by making each element of $$A$$ and $$B$$ a dot or  *vertex*, and draw an **edge** with an arrow for each $$(a,b) \in R$$. 

### Example - Flow Charts

>Flowcharts are relations of the form:

>$$R = \{(m,n) \mid$$ "do $$m$$ before $$n$$" $$\}$$

## Other ways we can write relations - T/F Matrix


You can represent relation $$R \subseteq A \times B$$ as a $$|A| \times |B|$$ matrix $$M$$.

If $$(a,b) \in R$$, then on the matrix $$M[a,b] = T$$, otherwise  $$M[a,b] = F$$.

### Example - Equality

$$R = \{(x,y) \in [1,2,3,4] \mid x = y \}$$

## Complement and Inverse

Every relations $$R \subseteq A \times B$$ has a **complement** and an **inverse**.

### Complement Definition
The *complement* of $$R$$, denoted $$\bar{R}$$, consists of all pairs from $$A \times B$$ that are not in R.

$$\bar{R} = \{ (x,y) \mid x \in A \land y \in B \land (x,y) \notin R \}$$

### Inverse Definition
The *inverse* of $$R$$, denoted $$R^{-1}$$, is obtained by simply swapping the order of every pair.

$$R^{-1} = \{ (y,x) \mid (x,y) \in R\}$$



## Complement and Inverse Example

Let $$P$$ be a group of coworkers: 

$$P = \{Alice, Bob, Chris \}$$

Say Alice sends an email to everyone else. Say Chris replies to her email.

$$R = \{ (a,b) \mid a,b \in P \land a \textrm{ sent an email to } b \}$$

So, $$R =$$

The complement, $$\bar{R}$$, is the set $$(a,b)$$ where $$a$$ did not send an email to $$b$$.

$$\bar{R} =$$

The inverse, $$R^{-1}$$, is the set of $$(b,a)$$ where $$b$$ received an email from $$a$$.

$$R^{-1} =$$


## Binary Relations over a Single Set

We are going to discuss some properties of binary relation $$R \subseteq A \times A$$


## Reflexive Relations

$$R \subseteq A \times A$$

$$R$$ is **reflexive** iff $$\forall x \in A, x R x$$.

Another way to say this is $$\forall x \in A, (x R x)$$ holds.

### Example

>$$R_{\textrm{equal}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x = y \}$$

>Is this reflexive?

>**Answer:**

>$$R_{\textrm{nequal}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x \neq y \}$$

>Is this reflexive?

>**Answer:**



## Irreflexive Relations

$$R$$ is **irreflexive** iff $$\forall x \in A, (x \cancel{R} x)$$

Another way to say this is $$\forall x \in A, (x R x)$$ does not hold.

### Example

>$$R_{\textrm{equal}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x = y \}$$

>Is this irreflexive?

>**Answer:**

>$$R_{\textrm{nequal}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x \neq y \}$$

>Is this irreflexive?

>**Answer:**



## Symmetric Relations

$$R$$ is **symmetric** iff $$\forall x,y \in A, (x R y \implies y R x)$$

### Example

>$$R_{\textrm{equal}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x = y \}$$

>Is this symmetric?

>**Answer:**

>$$R_{\textrm{nequal}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x \neq y \}$$

>Is this symmetric?

>**Answer:**

>$$R_{\textrm{lessthan}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x < y \}$$

>Is this symmetric?

>**Answer:**


## Antisymmetric Relations

$$R$$ is **antisymmetric** iff $$\forall x \neq y \in A, (x R y \implies y \cancel{R} x)$$

You can also say, if $$x R y$$ holds, then $$y R x$$ does not hold.

### Example

>$$R_{\textrm{lessthan}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x < y \}$$

>Is this antisymmetric?

>**Answer:**

>$$R_{\textrm{lessthaneq}} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \land x \leq y \}$$

>Is this antisymmetric?

>**Answer:**
